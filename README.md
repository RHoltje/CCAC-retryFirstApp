going step by step through the videos

first group of files is from the first videos, the one that didn't have sound and the remake
<br>
second group is after second video, a short one on strings.xml
<br>
third group after third video, two ways to do onClick events in java code
<br>
fourth group after fourth video, saving user input and displaying it 
<br>
final set of files, what I would have turned in if I had figured it out last week.
